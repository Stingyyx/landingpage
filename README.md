# UniGO Landing Page

Futuristic, neon/cosmic landing page built with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL printed in the terminal.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- The Android APK download now uses a direct Google Drive link - no local file needed.
- Update the iOS link in `src/LandingPage.tsx` when the App Store URL is available.
